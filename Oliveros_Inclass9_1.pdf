#1. Build a first logistic model using only SOM1, SOM2, SOM3, SOM4 and SOM5. What are the 
#important features in this model? What is the interpretation of the SOM1 coefficient?

model1 <- glm(disorder ~ som1 + som2 + som3 + som4 + som5, 
data=final, family="binomial")
summary(model1)
exp(model1$coef)

#Line above gets the odd ratios of the coeficients of model1.
#It seems that it is able to predict disorder. Som1 has a higher
#p value than the rest in model1. Therefore markers 2 3 4 and 5 
#are more important features.

#2. Build a second model using only SOM6, SOM7, SOM8, SOM9. What are the most important 
#features in this model?

model2 <- glm(disorder ~ som6 + som7 + som8 + som9, data=final, 
family="binomial")
summary(model2)
exp(model2$coef)

#Marker 8 has a higher p value than the other markers making the
#other markers more important. However, note that marker 8 still
#has a higher p value than marker 1 from the first model.

#3. Build a third model using only SOM10, SOM11, SOM12, SOM13, SOM14. What are the most 
#important features in this model?

model3 <- glm(disorder ~ som10 + som11 + som12 + som13 + som14, 
data=final, family="binomial")
summary(model3)
exp(model3$coef)

#All of the markers have relatively low p values. The most important feature 
#of this model to note is som12 having the lowest p value.

#4. Compare the three models. Which one is better at predicting the likelihood of the disorder? 

#I would say model1 is the best at predicting the likelihood of the disorder. This is 
#due to the fact that it has more important features than other models. Also model3 has
# a high std meaning that the data is crowded.
